.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans either two or three Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone for the {partner-product-acronym} user interface.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** In one public subnet:
*** An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Linux instance to bootstrap the installation of {partner-product-name} in an Amazon EKS cluster and serve as administrator bastion host.
*** An Amazon EC2 Windows bastion host for access to the {partner-product-short-name} user interface.
* In the private subnets:
** A group of Amazon EKS nodes in an Auto Scaling Group with Contour Envoy ingress controller pods and the TAP installation. For a complete list of the {partner-product-short-name} packages, refer to https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.3/tap/GUID-install-components.html#verify-the-installed-packages-1[Verify the installed packages].
** A Network Load Balancer (NLB) attached to the private subnets to direct traffic to the Contour Envoy pod. The Contour Envoy container provides ingress and reverse proxy to the {partner-product-acronym} pods for the {partner-product-acronym} user interface and metadata store.
* Amazon CloudWatch for storing Linux bastion host metrics and {partner-product-acronym} bootstrap logs.
* AWS Secrets Manager for storing {partner-registry} credentials for the {partner-product-acronym} cluster.
* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) for five private repositories: three for {partner-product-acronym} installation and two for sample workload installation.
* Amazon EKS for the Kubernetes control plane cluster that runs {partner-product-acronym}, Contour Envoy, and other containerized applications.
