//Add any unique troubleshooting steps here.

For troubleshooting common Partner Solution issues, refer to the https://fwd.aws/rA69w?[AWS Partner Solution General Information Guide^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting CloudFormation^].

You can verify CloudFormation stack deployment using the AWS Management Console. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-view-stack-data-resources.html[Viewing AWS CloudFormation stack data and resources on the AWS Management Console^].

Refer to the following resources to troubleshoot {partner-product-name}.

* https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/{partner-product-version-majmin}/tap/troubleshooting-tap-troubleshoot-install-tap.html[Troubleshoot installing {partner-product-short-name}^]
* https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/{partner-product-version-majmin}/tap/troubleshooting-tap-troubleshoot-using-tap.html[Troubleshoot using {partner-product-short-name}^]

=== Cannot connect to {partner-product-short-name} console after deployment
If you cannot access the {partner-product-short-name} console after deployment, do the following:

* Ensure that you are attempting to access the {partner-product-short-name} URL from a location with internet connectivity. The {partner-product-short-name} website GUI URL can only be accessed from endpoints with a route to the private VPC network, such as from the Amazon EC2 Windows bastion host instance.

* Verify that the CloudFormation stack deployment completed successfully. If the stack deployed successfully, review the {partner-product-short-name} bootstrap logs.

=== Deployment fails to complete within two hours

If the deployment takes over two hours to complete or you do not receive a notification that the Partner Solution has completed, do the following:

. Sign in to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home[AWS Management Console^], and open the CloudFormation console.
. Choose the Partner Solution base stack.
. Choose the *Outputs* tab.
. Copy the ID of the `TAPLogGroup`.
+
[#taploggroupoutput]
.TAPLogGroupOutput
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/TAPLogGroupOutput.png[LogGroupOutput]

[start=5]
. Search the CloudWatch log groups for the `TAPLogGroup` ID.
+
[#cloudwatchloggroup]
.CloudWatchLogGroup
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/CloudWatchLogGroup.png[CloudWatchLogGroup]

[start=6]
. Choose the log group to view the log streams file `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`. The TAP output scripts output from the Linux Bastion EC2 instance.
+
[#cloudinitoutput]
.CloudInitOutput
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/CloudInitOutput.png[CloudInitOutput]

NOTE: Logs can also be found in the `+/var/log/cloud-init-output.log+` file on the Linux bastion host.

=== TAP package or cloud-init script failure
The deployment might fail because TAP packages fail to reconcile or `cloud-init` scripts fail.

. Sign in to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home[AWS Management Console^], and open the CloudFormation console.
. Choose the innermost nested CloudFormation stack that failed.

+
[#nestedfailedstack]
.Nested failed stack
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/NestedFailedStack.png[Nested failed stack]

[start=3]
. Choose the *Events* tab.
. Find and correct the error in the *Status reason* column.
+
[#failedstackevents]
.Events tab of failed stack
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/FailedStackEvents.png[Failed stack events]

[start=5]
. Update the stack. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks.html[AWS CloudFormation stack updates^].
. If the CloudFormation stack is in *UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED* status, delete the stack and redeploy the Partner Solution. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html[Deleting a stack on the AWS CloudFormation console^].

=== {partner-product-short-name} installation fails with a EULA error
You must accept the relevant {partner-product-short-nam} EULAs during deployment before you can download the {partner-product-short-name} packages from the {partner-registry}. For more information, refer to https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/{partner-product-version-majmin}/tap/install-tanzu-cli.html#accept-the-end-user-license-agreements-0[Accept the End User License Agreements^].


For more details about the `+.status.usefulErrorMessage+` error, connect to the Linux bastion host using SSH. Then run the following commands. For `<PACKAGE-NAME>`, substitute the name of the package to target.

----
tanzu package installed list -A
tanzu package installed get <PACKAGE-NAME> --namespace tap-install
----

=== Relocation of images to Amazon ECR does not complete

If you have chosen to relocate {partner-product-short-name} images to Amazon ECR and this did not complete successfully, run the following command. This command takes 30–45 minutes to complete.

----
/home/ubuntu/tap-setup-scripts/src/tap-main.sh -c relocate
----

Run the following commands to reinstall {partner-product-short-name}.

----
/home/ubuntu/tap-setup-scripts/src/tap-main.sh -c install single
----

For a multicluster installation of the Partner Solution, run the following command against the affected cluster type. Substitute `view`, `run`, `iterate`, or `build` for `<cluster-type>` in the command.

----
/home/ubuntu/tap-setup-scripts/src/tap-main.sh -c install <cluster-type>
----


=== One or more {partner-product-short-name} packages fail to reconcile

The following issues might cause the {partner-product-short-name} packages fail to reconcile.

* An infrastructure issue causing the task to take longer to run than the timeout value allows.
* A race condition between components.

To troubleshoot, do the following:

. Connect to the Linux bastion host using SSH. Then run the following command to verify the installation status.
+
----
tanzu package installed list -A
----
+
. If the installation has stopped running, one or more reconciliations have likely failed. For a single-cluster installation of the Partner Solution, run the following command.
+
----
/home/ubuntu/tap-setup-scripts/src/tap-main.sh -c install single
----
+
For a multicluster installation of the Partner Solution, run the following command against the affected cluster type. Substitute `view`, `run`, `iterate`, or `build` for `<cluster-type>` in the command.
+
----
/home/ubuntu/tap-setup-scripts/src/tap-main.sh -c install <cluster-type>
----

=== Cannot log in to the bastion host

If you cannot log in to the Windows EC2 bastion host, it is likely that you chose a ED25519 key pair during deployment instead of an RSA key pair. Amazon EC2 Windows instances do not support ED25519 key pairs. The CloudFormation stack deploys successfully, but you cannot retrieve the automatically generated password for the Windows bastion host. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 key pairs and Windows instances^].

To troubleshoot, try the following options:

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ResettingAdminPassword_EC2Launchv2.html[Reset the Windows administrator password using ECLaunch v2^].
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-direct.html[Update the CloudFormation stack^] to use an RSA key pair. Doing this replaces all Amazon EC2 instances (Windows and Linux) and Amazon EKS nodes that use this key. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-instance.html#cfn-ec2-instance-keyname[KeyName^].
* Customize the CloudFormation template to use a separate key pair for the Windows bastion host. Then update the CloudFormation stack. This option only replaces the Windows bastion host instance. Instructions for implementing this are beyond the scope of this guide.
* https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/[Contact AWS technical support^].

=== Deployment parameter errors

You will encounter errors when entering deployment parameters if Availability Zones, remote access Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range, or key pair are invalid, incorrectly configured, or absent.

* Ensure that you configure Availability Zones in the deployment AWS Region before deployment.
* The *Number of Availability Zones* parameter must match the *Availability Zones* parameter.
+
[#availabiltyzones]
.Availability Zones and Number of Availability Zones parameters
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/AvailabilityZones.png[Availability Zones parameters]

* For the *Remote access CIDR* parameter, ensure that you choose a valid remote access CIDR.
+
[#remoteCIDR]
.Remote access CIDR parameter
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/RemoteCIDR.png[Remote CIDR]

* You must create an RSA key pair before deploying the Partner Solution. For more information, refer to link:#_create_an_rsa_key_pair[Create an RSA key pair], earlier in this guide. During deployment, for *EC2 key pair name*, choose an RSA key pair.

[#ec2keypairname]
.EC2 key pair name parameter
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/KeyPair.png[Key pair]

=== RegionalSharedResources and AccountSharedResources CloudFormation stacks fail to deploy

The `RegionalSharedResources` stack creates resources in each Region to which the Partner Solution is deployed. The `AccountSharedResources` stack creates resources in a single Region.

If `RegionalSharedResources` and `AccountSharedResources` fail to deploy, delete the IAM roles that they both create and deploy the Partner Solution to a single Region. Roles created by these stacks include `qs` or `quickstart`. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage_delete.html[Deleting roles or instance profiles^].

`RegionalSharedResources` and `AccountSharedResources` stacks remain deployed between Partner Solution deployments by design.

=== Custom IAM roles

The Partner Solution deployment might fail if you choose a role for the *IAM role—optional* parameter during deployment. It is not recommended to use a custom IAM role for this Partner Solution.

[#qsiamroleoptional]
.IAM role—optional parameter
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/QSIamRoleOptional.png[IAM role optional]

=== TAP workload deployment fails

If you cannot access the {partner-product-acronym} URL from the Linux or Windows EC2 instances, or if the {partner-product-acronym} workload is not visible in the {partner-product-acronym} supply chain, do the following:

. Connect to the `VMwareLinuxBastionInstance` EC2 instance using SSH.
. Run the following commands. They will provide the workload status and logs that contain error messages.
+
----
tanzu apps workload list -n tap-workload
tanzu apps workload tail tanzu-java-web-app-workload -n tap-workload --since 10m –timestamp
----
+
. If the status and logs do not contain errors, ensure that the DNS is correctly configured. In the Route53 console, ensure that the kubernetes cluster IP records have `CNAME` as the record type.
