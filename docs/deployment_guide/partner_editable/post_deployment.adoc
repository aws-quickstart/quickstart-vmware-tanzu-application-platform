=== Security configuration and management tasks

After you successfully deploy this Partner Solution, confirm that your resources and services are updated and configured (including any required patches) to meet your security and other needs. For more information, refer to the https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/[AWS Shared Responsibility Model^].

=== Access the {partner-product-name} user interface

Access the {partner-product-name} user interface using the Amazon EC2 Windows bastion host instance that is deployed into a public subnet.

To retrieve the password for the Windows bastion host instance, refer to https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/retrieve-windows-admin-password/[How do I retrieve my Windows administrator password after launching an instance?^] To connect to the bastion host, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html[Connect to your Windows instance^].

The {partner-product-name} user interface is not available as a public URL. You can use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html[Site&#8209;to&#8209;Site VPN^] or https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/[AWS Direct Connect^] to configure direct access to the VPC from your enterprise network.
